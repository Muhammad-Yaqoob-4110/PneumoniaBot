Because of the huge diseas e burden and the resultant \\nattributable morbidity and mortality, so much importance is given for accurate diagnosis and \\ntreatment  of this condition. Consequently, the diagnosis is \\ndifficult and most often delayed. The lack of a “gold standard” for diagnosis further \\ncompounds  this p roblem.', 'Several treatment \\nstrategies and guidelines  have been recommended by expert panels for appropriate treatment \\nof these patients without contributing to development of drug resistance. Significant advances \\nhave been made in this field over the past few decades, which will reviewed in this chapter to \\nimprove our understanding of the symptoms of VAP and help us to accu rately diagnosis and \\ntreat this condition.

The modern era of \\noxygen therapy began after World War I. He described many physiological details and was also aware \\nof possible side effects  of providing p ure oxygen inhalations (Haldane 1917). He also developed equipment  for a cheap and \\nefficient way of providing oxygen to patients. The same year Meltzer published a paper \\ndiscussing the therapeutic value of oxygen delivered under positive pressure  (Meltzer 1917).', 'Subsequent works of Haldane, Barcroft and others at that time gave scientific background to \\nthe physiological role of oxygen and its therapeutic use  in current medicine. History of Oxygen use in Pneumonia  \\n \\nThe first report about use of oxygen  in patients suffering with pneumonia  was published  \\nin 1887. The first experimental data about use of oxygen  in animals with laboratory evoked \\npneumonia  were published by Binger in 1928. This was the first \\nexperimental observation suggesting a beneficial role of oxygen therapy  in decreasing \\nmortality  in pneumonia.', 'In 1927 Prendergast compared medical  use and costs of nasal tubes, Haldane masks and \\noxygen  chambers as different methods of oxygen administration to pneumonia  sufferers and \\nsuggested that nasal tube “is perhaps the best of them for general use” (Prendergast 1927). During the 2nd World War a new era of pneumonia  treatment  started with the discovery  \\nof penicillin. Michael Eisenhut and Tomasz Rajkowski  40 \\noxygen concentrators were developed enabling wider use of oxygen in medicine. At the same \\ntime delivery methods of  oxygen, other that through inhalation, were abandoned.', 'Below we \\npresent a review of the current evidence  for use of oxygen in patients with pneumonia. The \\nmajority  of available data are from studies in the paediatric popu lation. The author concluded that in view of above \\nfindings efforts should be made to improve the detection  of hypoxemia and to provide oxygen  \\nearlier to more children with severe acute lower respiratory tract infection s. Even more \\nstriking results come from another prospective cohort study in Gambia (Usen 1999).

The latter, due to its simplicity and non invasive character, is used as a gold \\nstandard in assessment  of hypoxemia  (Royas -Reyes 2009, Duke 2008). The cut off values therefore had to be determined by \\nstudying healthy children from the same population. Moreover in low income  countries where health  resources  are \\nlimited pulse oximeters may not be available.', 'Inability to drink was assessed as “related” to mortality and in view of little \\ndata relationship to hypoxemia w as not assessed.

Efficacy of oxygen therapy  was assessed by analysis of arterial blood \\ngas and arterial oxygen saturation  (SaO 2). Acceptability  in terms of child comfort was \\nassessed by a tolerance score as perceived by the mother. The head box and nasal \\ncannula were the best t olerated methods for delivery oxygen. Significant side effects  were \\nnot noted.', 'Above data showed that there is currently not enough evidence  to suggest \\nsuperiority of one method of oxygen delivery over another. The Guideli ne Development Group mentioned results of a prospective \\nstudy from Zambia where the risk  of death from pneumonia was significantly increased when \\nhypoxemia was present (Smyth 1998).

An important aspect of CPIS, which has been less investigated, is the i nterobserver \\nreliability. According to the CDC \\nguidelines , VAP should be suspected in any patient with at least one of the following a) f ever \\n(>38°C or >100.', 'Thus , we can safely conclude that  the \\nclinical approach to  management  irrespective of the criteria used  will help effective \\nmanagement of VAP, without promoting the unnecessary use of broad -spectrum \\nantimicrobial therapy. Improperly collected specimen can \\nlead to false positive  and false negative  results. There are several recommendations  for \\nensuring proper quality of secretions. The timing of collection of the specimens is very \\nimportant.', 'The specimen for culture shoul d ideally be collected before starting antibiotics or \\nwhen there is no change in antibiotic  therapy  in the past 3 days.

Therefore, \\nGiemsa st aining can be considered as a useful aid for selecting an effective antimicrobial \\ntreatment  before culture  results are available. These techni ques have been evaluated \\nby several workers  and each technique was found to have some merits and demerits. Despite \\ntheir limitations all these techniques have a specific role in the diagnosis of VAP.', 'The cultures are read semi -\\nquantitatively by observing the gro wth in the four quadrants. Some auth ors use only 4 scales of growth such as rare, light, moderate and heavy [57]. Therefore, \\nfurther studies are needed to optimize the diagnostic threshold of semi -quantitative cultures. If the threshold is optimized, this technique can be considered as a potential alternative for \\nquantitative culture  in resource poor settings. The concentrations mentioned above vary with the \\nsite of collection and/or technique of sampling.', 'Quantitat ive culture was originally \\nstandardized by  Baselski et al  [35]. Quantitative culture is performed by serial dilution of the \\nspecimen in 0. 9% sterile  saline solutio n. Local anesthetics  are not routinely  used [66].

Twenty -milliliter saline aliquots are injected  each time, for a total of 200 ml (10  \\naliquots). There are several modifications  of this technique.', 'The various bronchoscopically collected  specimens should be  transferred to the \\nmicrobiological  laboratory within 45 min  and processed immediately. 100 µl of this \\nsample should be directly added to 9.

The \\nmanagement of Pneumocystis pneumonia remains a major challenge for all physicians caring \\nfor immunosuppressed patients.', 'Despite \\navailability of effective antibiotic treatment the mortality remains 6 to 12% in patient s \\nadmitted to hospital with community acquired pneumonia and over 50% in patients admitted \\nto the intensive care unit (figures from the United Kingdom). Supportive treatment explored in patients with pneumonia includes oxygen in a \\nvariety of applications, fluid therapy regimens, chest physiotherapy, steroid treatment, \\ngranulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment, surfactant application and vitamins A, C and \\nD, zinc, protein and calorie supplements.', 'Studies showed that management of patients with \\nmonitoring of oxygen levels and oxygen delivery guided by oxygen saturation levels can \\nreduce hospitalisation.

The lack of a gold \\nstandard for the diagnosis of VAP makes an int erpretation of the literature complex, and \\ndifferences in the incidence of VAP occur as a result of the definitions used and people doing \\nthe surveillance.', 'The nosocomial infection preventive measures, principally the hand hygiene  of the \\nhealth -care personne l and visitors, the correct asepsis before invasive procedures, the \\nadequacy of antibiotics policy , and the correct nutrition  of our children  have demonstrated to \\nreduce the risk  of suffering a  hospita l-acquired infection even in 50 %.

The management  of Pneumocystis pneumonia \\nremains a major challenge for all physicians  caring for immuno suppressed patients. This \\nmicroorganism  causes opportunistic infection , particularly pneumonia , in patients who have \\nimpaired immunity. The general term for clinical disease c aused by Pneumocystis  is \\npneumocystosis.', 'Pneumocytsis  was originally identified in 1909 by Carlos Chagas in the lungs of guinea \\npigs that were inoculated with the blood  of trypanomiasis patients. One year later, \\nAntonio Carini made a similar description in the lungs of rats infected by Trypanosoma \\nlewisi.', 'For se ven decades, most investigators thought Pneumocystis organisms to be protozoans \\nbecause they do not look much like fungi  base on the histological characteristics of its \\ntrophozoite and cyst  life forms, fail to grow m uch in culture , and are not eliminated from \\npatients by treatment  with the usual antifungal agents. By contrast, drugs , such as \\ntrimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, which are often useful in treatin g protozoan \\ninfections, are also active against Pneumocystis.', 'Subsequent studies using molecular techniques  allowed knowing other aspects, as it is a \\nubiquitou s fungus with pulmonary tropism , which colonizes only mammals  and that have a \\nhigh specificity for the host  (stenoxenism). Therefore, human  pneumocystosis is \\nnot a zoonotic disease, and this notion has impor tant implications for the epidemiology  of \\nhuman -derived Pneumocystis. Pneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumo nia 3 \\nPneumocystis  is generally regarded as an opportunistic microorganism  causing serious \\npneumonia  in immunocompromised  patients, especially in those with AIDS.', 'However, \\nPneumocystis  was first identified as a human -pathogen in premature or malnourished infants  \\nsuffering from inte rstitial plasma cell pneumonia in European countries around World War I I, \\noccasionally occurring in epidemics [2,3]. During the 1990s , the introduction \\nof highly active antiretroviral therapy  (HAART ) for HIV infection  and Pneumocystis  \\nchemoprophylaxis reduced the frequency of PcP.', 'Although at the beginning  of th is century, \\nthe incidence  of pneumonia caused by this microorganism among subjects with HIV infection \\nhas decreased in developed countries , the prevalence of AIDS -related PcP in developing \\ncountries  remains high and poorly controlled. jirovecii infection  goes beyond AIDS  patients since with the \\nrising number of patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies  for autoimmune diseases , \\nmalignancies, allogeneic bone  marrow  or solid organ  transplantations, PcP is more and more \\nrecognized in non -HIV immunosuppressed patients  [5,6,8].', 'Underlying conditions associated \\nwith PcP in HIV -negative patients include hematologic or solid malign ancies, allograft \\ntransplantation , autoimmune inflammatory disorders (mainly Wegener granulomatosis and \\nsystemic lupus erythematosus ), inflammatory bowel disease , protein -calorie  malnutrition , and \\ncongenital immunodeficiency  disorders [5 ,6,8-12]. Lately, PcP has been reported in patients \\nundergone treatment  with new biological tumor  necrosis factor -alpha antagonist  agents \\n(adalimumab , infliximab , etanercept ) and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , rituximab  [13-16].', 'On the other hand, few treatment  options exist for \\npatients with PcP. Thus, m anagement  of PcP remains a major challenge  to all physicians  \\ncaring for these patients. Many investigators have attempted to \\ncultivate Pneumocystis  using a variety of techniques , but have had limited success, impeding \\nstudies of Pneumocystis. Pneumonia models  in immune -suppressed animals remain the main \\nsource of organisms for laboratory studies , yet these  approaches have numerous inherent \\ndifficulties.', 'All stages are found in lungs but the trophozoite stage is the vegetative state  that \\npredomin ates over the cystic form during infection  by approximately 10:1. During infection, \\nmost trophic forms are haploid  and it has been hypothesized that trophic forms can conjugate \\nand develop into cysts. It has been \\nsuggested that trophic forms originate from the intracystic nuclei of the mature  cyst as its \\nruptures and then undergo vegetative growth  or conjugation  to re -form the cysts forms.', 'It  is \\nfurther proposed that they may also undergo asexual reproduction  through haploid mitosis  \\nand binary fission. In an infected host , Pneumocystis  exists almost exclusively within lung \\nalveoli. This adherence is characterized by close apposition of the cel l surface  without \\nfusion  of the membranes and strongly promotes proliferation  of the organism. Pneumocystis  \\nmaintains an extracellular existence within alveoli, and probably obtains  essential nutrients  \\nfrom the alveolar fluid  or living cells.', 'The adherence of Pneumocystis  also inhibits the growth \\nof lung epithelial cells. Although organism attachment  to alveo li epithelial cells is essential \\nfor Pneumocystis  infection and propagation , invasion of host cells is uncommon and \\nextrapulmonary pneumocystosis occurs only in the setting of severe immunosuppression. Mononuclear thin -\\nwalled trophic forms (small arrows) are attached to type 1 epithelial alveolar cells. While an electron -lucent layer develops in \\nintermediate sporocytes, mitotic nuclear divisions proceed.', 'An additional mitotic replication  leads to a thick -\\nwalled late spor ocyte containing eight haploid  (n) nuclei. These forms are able to leave the cyst and subsequently attach to type I alveolar cells. However, the clinical picture in individual patients is variable and many \\ninfectious and non -infectious processes can present identically. In patients infected with HIV , PcP  is a common AIDS -defining illness and occurs most \\nfrequently in subjects with a CD4+ count less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter.', 'Non-HIV immunosuppressed patients usually have a more rapid onset than those infected \\nwith HIV. PcP usually has a subacute  presentation with more insidious involvement in \\npatients with HIV infection  than in non -HIV immunosuppressed patients where PcP is much \\nmore likely to be an acute illness causing severe respiratory distress  that frequently require s \\nmechanical v entilation  within the first several days [2 3,24]. In children , the symptoms  of PcP \\ncan often be quite subtle, with an increased respiratory rate  heralding the first s ign of \\nrespiratory tract involvement.', 'In all cases, a high index of suspicion and a thorough history  are key factors in early \\ndetection  of PcP. Lung auscultation  usually reveals few abnormalities with dry cackles or rhonchi  present in \\nless than 50% of patients. Individuals with PcP can be hypoxemic with respiratory alkalos is \\nbut can also have normal alveolar -arterial gradients if identified early in the natural history of \\ntheir disease. Elevated serum  levels of lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH) have been related with \\nPcP and probably reflects lung parenchymal damage but is not specific.', 'However, almost every conceivable radiographic presentation has been linked to PcP, \\nincluding asymmetrical infiltrates, nodular densities, cavitary lesions , lymphadenopaties, \\npleural effusion s, pneumatocele s, and pneumothorax. Patients who receive aerosolized \\npentamidine have an increased frequency of upper -lobe infiltrates , pneumothorax, or cystic \\nlesions. However, a negative high -resolution computed tomography scan may allow exclusion  of PcP \\nin such patients.', 'Pneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumo nia 7 \\nImmunorestitution disease (IRD) is defined as an acute symptomatic or paradoxical \\ndeterioration of a (most probably) preexisting infection  that is temporally related to the \\nrecovery  of the immune system  and it is due to immunopathological damage associated with \\nthe reversal of immunosuppressive processes. PcP manifesting as a form of IRD has been \\ndescribed in both HIV  and non -HIV immunosuppressed patients [2 8-30].', 'In non -HIV immunosuppressed patients , the clinical symptoms  of PcP may be unmasked \\nduring the reversal of immunosuppression , often at the time when the dose of steroids  is \\ntapered or when the endogenous steroid production is reduced [3 3,34]. Rapid reduction of \\nimmunosuppressive therapy  has been implicated as a predisposing factor for the development \\nof PcP in non -HIV immunosuppressed patients. In this group of patients, PcP manifesting as \\nIRD often runs an acute and fulminant course, with nonspecific lesions  on chest radiographs \\nand high lymphocyte counts.', 'jirovecii  infection  (extrapulmonary \\npneumocystosis) are distinctly unusual. Extrapulmonary pneumocystosis has been reported \\nprimarily amon g HIV -infected patients, particularly those who receive aerosolized \\npentamidine for prophylaxis  of PcP. Mainly, during the terminal stage of HIV -related disease \\nPneumocystis  organisms may disseminate from the lungs to other organs  where they induce \\nsecondary visceral lesions. However, at times  pulmonary infection may not be apparent when \\nextrapulmonary lesions are detected.', 'For HIV -infected patients, extrapulmonary \\npneumocystosis limited to the choroid  layer or ear (external auditory canal or middle ear) has \\na better prognosis , with good response  to specific treatment , than disseminated \\npneumocystosis in multiple noncontiguous s ites. Disseminated pneumocystosis is usually \\nclinically evident, with symptoms  related to the affected organs. Non -HIV-associated extrapulmonary pneumocystosis has been rarely reported.', 'In all cases, the clinical diagnosis  is complicated because no combination of symptoms , \\nsigns , blood  chemistries, or radiographic findings is specific of  Pneumocystis  infection. As \\nsuch, identification  of Pneumocystis organisms or its DNA  in a clinically relevant sample is \\nrequired to make a diagnosis. 8 \\nDiagnosis  \\n \\nThe single most important diagnostic t ool for Pneumocystis  infection  is a high clinical \\nsuspicion.', 'In the right clinical setting, an immunosuppressed patient with new onset of \\ndyspnea  or new symptoms  of pneumonia , with or wit hout radiological findings, should \\nprompt further evaluation, particularly if they are not receiving chemoprophylaxis. jirovecii organisms are usually detected in broncho alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), \\ninduced sputum  (IS) samples , or lung biopsy  specimens by means of light  microscopy  (figure \\n3), immunofluorescence , or molecular methods. No in vitro system for obtaining routinely \\nPneumocystis  isolates from patients is available.', 'Using light microscopy, parasites , especially \\nmature cysts, can be detected using phase contrast or Nomarski interference  contrast on wet \\nsmears. The cell wall of cystic and sporocytic forms appears as a \\nclear, thin peripheral halo. TBO or GMS stains facilitate rapid parasite  detection , even at low magnification, in  all \\nkinds of clinical specimens. However, these dyes  also stain the cell wall of yeasts or other \\nfungi.', 'In \\nfact, Giemsa and other stains with similar cytological affinities, such as Diff Quick or RAL -\\n555, cause the parasite nuclei  to stain pinkish purple and the cytoplasm  to stain blue [40,41]. They do not stain cystic or sporocytic walls, which appear like a clear peripheral halo around \\ncystic form s. These polychrome stains make it possible accurately to distinguish \\nPneumocystis trophic or cystic forms from other fungi and also from host  cells or cell debris.', 'In order to detect Pneumocystis organisms in histological sections from lung or other \\norgans , pathologists targ et usually the cystic forms, since trophic ones are uneasily \\nidentifiable in paraffin -embedded tissues. Therefore, t hey use GMS and, less frequently, TBO \\nstaining procedures adapted to tissue  sections. Moreover, PCR assays followed by direct sequencing  or other strategies were used \\nfor typing Pneumocysti s isolates in order to identify parasite strains and to explore correlation  \\nbetween specific genotypes and virulence, transmissibility or drug susceptibility.', 'PCR, \\nespecially nested PCR  assays a pplied to noninvasive samples, have also been used to detect \\nPneumocystis colonization  either in susceptible individuals  or in apparently healthy people, \\nincluding healthcare staffs in hospitals [5 5,58,59 ].', 'For Pc P diagnosis in humans, conventional or real -time PCR  assays based on the \\namplification of the large subunit of mitochondr ial ribosomal DNA  (mtLSUrDNA) [51,60 ] \\nare the most commonly used, but many other sequences have been targeted ( Major Surface \\nGlycoprotein, Internal Transcribed Spacers, Thymidylate Synthase, Dihydrofolate Reductase, \\nheat-shock  protein 70, etc. In general, conventional , or real -time Pneumocystis PCR  assays , have represented a \\nsignificant advance in PcP laboratory diagnosis.', 'Pneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumo nia 13 \\naccurate, early diagnosis of Pneumocystis  infection  [54], which should lead to a decreased \\nduration from onset of symptoms  to treatment. In addition, PCR assay  may reveal PcP in patients with negative \\nmicroscopic test. Actually, a positive PCR result associated with a negative microscopic test \\nmay result from either Pneumocystis colonization or PcP.', 'In common practice, this difficulty \\nis often solved with careful clinical, radiological and laboratory assessme nt of the patient ‟s \\npathological condition, as is usually done with other infectious diseases , especially when their \\nagents are opportunistic pathogens. Thus, a quantitative real -time PCR assay that targeted the Pneumocystis \\nMajor Surface Glycoprotein (MSG) multigene family was applied to OW samples, and \\nrevealed significant differences between PcP patients an d Pneumocystis colonized subjects in \\nthe number of MSG copies.', 'Actually, it seems \\ndifficult to apply the same cutoff to AIDS  patients, patients with other underlying diseases , or \\nindividuals  receiving  chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of Pneumocystis colonization or subclinical \\ncarriage is usually retained when Pneumocystis DNA  is detected by PCR  methods in \\nrespiratory samples from immunodepressed or immun ocompetent subjects without symptoms  \\nor signs  of Pneumocystis infection , and who do not progress to PcP [7 2].', 'jirovecii  dihydropteroate \\nsynthase (DHPS) gene, which could potentia lly be linked with sulfa resistance. jirovecii culture  systems are unavailable, several groups have \\nassessed putative trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole drug resistance  by detecting Pneumocystis \\nDHPS mutations. Such mutations confer resistance to sulfa drugs  in other organisms, including Escherichia \\ncoli, Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Plasmodium falciparum.', 'jirovecii  DHPS mutant  \\nform has also been shown t o be more resistant to sulfamethoxazole in a Saccharomyces \\ncerevisiae  model [82 ], but it is still uncertain if Pneumocystis  DHPS mutations lead to drug \\nresistance in patients [ 83,84 ]. Serum BG appeared therefore as a good marker of Pneumocystis infection. In a recent study, it has b een observed that BG levels in non -HIV patients with PcP are \\nlower than in HIV patients.', 'These preliminary studies suggest that in the right clinical setting serum  BG may provide \\na useful noninvasive diagnostic adjunct for patients with Pneumocystis  infection. However, \\nadditional information is necessary to address the general specificity of BG in diagnosing PcP \\nversus other fungal infection s in diverse immune -suppressed patient populations and to \\ndifferentiate among patients with PcP an d patients with Pneumocystis  colonization.', 'The same group was unable to distinguish patien ts \\nwith acute PcP from the ones without PcP based on plasma SAM levels, though these levels \\nincreased significantly with effective anti -Pneumocystis treatment. 16 \\nc) KL-6 \\n \\nKL-6 is a mucin -like glycoprotein expressed on type II pneumocytes and bronchiolar \\nepithelial cells. This serological marker has been  found in elevated levels in several studies in \\npatients with PcP.', 'Recent investigations indicant that JKL -6 is more a \\ngeneralized marker for alve olar epithelial injury  [105] and can also be detected in non -fungal \\ninfection s such as Legionella , severe tuberculosis  and respiratory syncythial virus \\nbronchiolitis , and ev en in noninfectious interstitial lung disease  [106-108]. Therefore, the KL-\\n6 elevation in PcP is thought to be related to lung damage and regeneration  of epithelium  \\nlining and cannot  be used as a specified marker of Pneumocystis  infection.', 'd) Serological tests  \\n \\nSerum antibody  detection  constitutes an adjunctive strategy currently used to diagnose \\nsystemic fungal infection s, even in immunodepressed patients. However, t his strategy was \\nrarely used for PcP diagnosis because healthy subjects frequently have significant levels of \\nthe serum  Pneumocystis antibody. Management Strategies f or PCP \\n \\nThere is no universally agreed approach on the initial management  of patients with \\nsuspected PcP.', 'In AIDS -related PcP, the typical duration of therapy  is at least 21 days because of \\nthe risk  for relaps e with shorter treatment duration. In the absence of corticosteroid therapy , early and \\nreversible deterioration within the first 3 –5 days of therapy is typical.', 'Because of the potential for additive or synergistic toxicities associated with anti -\\nPneumocystis  and antiretroviral therapies, certain health -care providers delay initiation  of \\nHAART  until after the completion of anti -Pneumocystis  therapy , or until at least 2 weeks \\nafter initiating anti -Pneumocystis  therapy, despite some suggestion of  potential benefit of \\nearly HAART in the treatment  of pat ients with AIDS -related opportunistic infections \\n[112,116 ].', 'In order to correct ly manage  PcP, it is important to distinguish between \\nprogressive PcP, drug toxicity , and concomitant infection  if clinical deterioration is detected. T MP inhibits \\ndihydrofolate reductase and SMX  inhibits dihydrotperoate synthetase.

VAP is usually classified as either early onset,  occurring within the first 4 days of MV or \\nlate onset, developing five or more days after initiation  of MV.', 'Early -onset VAP usually has a \\nbetter prognosis  as it often less severe and is frequently caused by antibiotic  sensitive \\nbacteria. But these clinical parameters may be altered even in certain \\nnon-infectious conditions. Although an accurate diagnosis of \\nVAP can be made based on histopathological examination of lung tissue  obtained by biopsy  \\nor at autopsy , it cannot be used as a routine tool for diagnosis because of its invasive nature.', 'Because of the large disease burden and \\nthe resultant attributable morbidity  and mortality, there is a great interest in understanding the \\nsymptoms  and signs  of this complication and accurately diagnosing and treating it. Symptoms and Signs of VAP \\n \\nIn the critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation , the clinical symptoms  and signs  of \\npneumonia  are non -specific and varied. VAP should be suspected in all intubated patients \\nwith clinical symptoms  and signs of sepsis.', 'The symptoms observed in most patients with \\nVAP are fever , new onset of purulent tracheal secretions, change in character of tracheal \\nsecretions, increased respiratory secretions, increased suctioning requirements , new onset or \\nworsening cough , dyspnea  and tachypnea  [4,10 ]. Variability of the Symptoms and Signs of VAP \\n \\nThe systemic symptoms  and signs  of VAP are often non -specific, f or instance, fever  and \\nleukocytosis  can be caused by any condition that releases cytokines  like, interleukin -1, \\ninterleukin -6, tumor  necrosis factor  alpha, and  gamma interferon  [15,16 ].', 'Trauma, surgery, \\ndeep vein  thrombosis , pancreatitis , pulmonary embolism , pulmonary edema , and pulmonary \\ninfarction  are conditions that are often associated with fever and leukocytosis, as they induce \\ncytokine release as an inflammatory response  [15,16 ]. The presence of asymmetric pulmonary infiltrates on chest  radiograph  consistent with \\nVAP may be caused by various non -infectious conditions.', 'Atelectasis, emphysema , \\nasymmetric cardio -pulmonary edema , pulmonary contus ion, pulmonary hemorrhage , \\npulmonary embolism , chemical pneumonitis  and drug reaction may often show radiographic \\nfindings similar to that of VAP , challenging the accurate diagnosis of VAP [15,16,19 ]. However, studies have shown that certain chest radiograph  findings,  like \\nprogressive rapid cavitation of the pulmonary infiltrate, an air space process abutting a fissure \\nand a single air bronchogram were associated with 96% specificity for diagnosing VAP and \\ntherefore can be reliably used.', 'The \\ninterplay of various factors such as the altered immune response s in critically ill patients,  \\npresence of underlying conditions, intake of corticosteroids  and anti -inflammatory agents , \\nmakes the diagnosis of VAP so difficult. Clinical Diagnosis  \\n \\nThe clinical assessment  of VAP is usually based on presence of fever  (temperature  \\n>38. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis  of VAP was made  using a combination of these signs  \\nand symptoms.', 'The clinicians routinely suspect VAP when  the patient has a new or \\nprogressive lung infiltrate plus at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: fever , purulent  sputum , or \\nleukocytosi s [18,22,23 ]. As a result clinicians started using multiple criteria  for diagnosing VAP, with \\nemphasize on  certain findings over others. A major problem with the CPIS score proposed by \\nPugin et al is that it requires respiratory tract secretions cultures, thereby delaying the \\ndiagnosis by 24 –48 hours.', 'Nevertheless, Fagon et al  found \\nno significant differences in the accuracy of the clinical suspicion of VAP between either \\nindividual physicians  or physicians grouped by level of training. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC ) has recommended the following criteria for \\nclinically defining pneumonia  in patients on mechanical ventilation.', '2 Microbiological  Diagnosis  \\n \\nThe microbiological diagnosis of VAP is usually based on direct microscopic \\nexamination, qualitative, semi -quantitative and quantitative culture  of lower respiratory tract \\nsecretions obtained bronchos copically or non -bronchoscopically. After \\ncollection of the specimens either bronchoscopically or non -bronchoscopically, the \\npercentages of squamous and bronchial epithelial cells  may be used to predict heavy upper -\\nrespiratory contamination.', 'This study suggests \\nthat the  reliability  of Gram staining is variable, dependent on the result of the Gram staining.

It \\nincludes qualitative, semi -quantitative and quantitative cultures of the respiratory secretions \\nobtained bronchoscopically or non -bronchoscopically.', '1 Qualitative Culture  \\nQualitative  culture  is usually performed for endotracheal aspirates. It \\nis widely believed that qualitative culture results may not be very specific and so it cannot be \\nrelied on for treatment  of VAP patients. Therefor e, it was \\nsuggested that use of qualitative culture for deciding on continuation of antibiotic  therapy  \\nmay lead to overtreatment of even patients without VAP and subsequently contribute to \\ndevelopment of drug  resistance.', 'As the sensitivity of \\nquantitative cultures of tracheal  aspirates was significantly lower than th at of qualitative \\ncultures for VAP diagnosis , the  use of quantitative culture  alone may result in under -\\ndiagnosis of VAP, leading to inappropriate changes to  antibiotic regimens and, in some cases, \\nantibiotic delay or  withdrawal. Therefore, i n sev erely ill patients  receiving prior antibiotics  \\nquantitative cultures of tracheal aspirates should not  replace qualitative cultures for the \\npurpose of confirming  a clinical diagnosis  of VAP or adjusting antimicrobial  therapy.', '2 Semi -Quantitative Culture  \\nSemi -quantitative cultures are performed by streaking the endotracheal sample s onto \\nstandard culture  media  using  the four -quadrant streak technique. So, guiding therapy  on the basis of semi -quantitative cultures may result in \\nfailure to  identify potentially multiple -drug-resistant pathogens, and would also tend to \\npromote excessive  antibiotic  usage. In earlier  studies using semi -quantitative cultures , presence of “moderate” or “heavy”  \\ngrowth  was considered as diagnostic  threshold for  diagnosing VAP  [30,58,59 ].', 'However, a \\nrecent study  suggested use of light growth as diagnostic threshold , as it was found to have a \\nbetter  agreeme nt with quantitative culture. Due to  the variability in  sensitivity  and specificity of semi -quantitative endotracheal aspirate  \\ncultures and the lack of good scientific data for defin ing a diagnostic threshold that optimizes \\noutcomes, appropriate  antibiotic  selection based on  these culture methods is problematic. Currently, there are not many studies evaluating the use of semi -quantitative cultures for \\ndiagnosis of VAP.', '3 Quantitative Culture  \\nUnlike qualitative and semi -quantitative cultures which are usually performed only for \\nendotracheal aspirates, the quantitative culture  is done for a wide range of specimens. If the number of CFU/ml is equal \\nto or exceeds the threshold values for the particular technique, a diagnosis of pneumoni a is \\nmade. The selection of the lung segment is usually aided by simple chest radiograph , \\nthoracic  computed tomography  scan and/or visualiza tion of purulent secretion  from a specific \\nsegmental bronchus  during  bronchoscopy.', 'Bronchoscopic tracheobronchial secretion  (TBS) is usually aspirated through the working \\nchannel of the  bronchoscope  before performing BAL. For quantitative \\nanalysis, usually the  aspirate  is either mechanically  liquefied and homogenized by vortexing \\nfor 1 min with glass  beads  or mixed with sputolysin  and vortexed  thoroughly. Many studies  have demonstrated that these non -bronchoscopic techniques  can \\nbe considered as equivalent to bronchoscopic  techniques. For performing  non-bronchoscopic BAL, the patient  should initially be placed on 100% \\noxygen.', 'The endotrac heal aspirate  is collected using two catheters wherein a 8 F suction catheter  \\nis guided through the lumen  of a 14 F suction catheter to serve as a telescoping catheter and is \\ngently introduced through the endotracheal tube for approximately 24  cm. As all the three \\nbronchoscopic methods are having a good correlation , any of these sampling techniques  can \\nbe reliably used for diagnosis of VAP. Studies  have also shown  that non -bronchoscopic techniques  are compar able to \\nbronchoscopic  BAL.', 'Considering these potenti al limitations, a quantitative culture that exceeds a \\nthreshold value is not always diagnostic of VAP. The presence of VAP is confirmed  only \\nwhen the histopathological  findings are in accordance with the  quantitative culture result s. Therefore, if the lung  tissue s with the lesions \\nare not sample d, the histo patho logic al diagnosis of pneumonia  may be missed.', 'Epidem iological Investigation of VAP \\n \\nThe epidemiology  of VAP is more complex because of the coexistence of epidemic  cases \\ndue to the ICU strain with unrelated sporadic cases caused by different strains.

Diagnosis  \\n \\nThe clinical diagnosis of community -acquired staphylococcal pneumonia  is frequently \\ndifficult. In some cases of staphylococcal pneumonia, a history of preceding upper respiratory \\nor influenza -like illness could be elicited, however influenza is relatively infrequently \\ndocumented.', 'Conversely, documentation of staphylococcal pneumonia in individuals \\nadmitted for severe influenza is more frequent but often represents a complication of hospital \\nadmission and respiratory support, that is, a nosocomial infection of the hospital Acquired \\nPneumonia type (HAP) or Ventilatory Associat ed Pneumonia (VAP) type. Presently therefore, a high level of suspicion is probably the most \\nimportant factor in establishing an early rapid diagnosis.', 'CA-MRSA sh ould be suspected as the cause of CAP in the presence of the following key \\nfeatures: influenza -like prodrome, hemoptysis [24], severe respiratory symptoms, high fever, \\nleukopenia, hypotension, and a chest x -ray showing multilobular infiltrates, with or without \\ncavitation in addition to an appropriate epidemiological background particularly in a patient \\nwith aprecceding skin or soft tissue infection known to be caused by MRSA [11]. Therapy   \\n \\nThe first, and arguably the most important, aspect of treatment is the need  for rapid \\ninstitution of appropriate antibiotic therapy.', 'Pneumonia Caused by Methicillin -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus  \\n \\nPneumonia caused by MSSA strains containing MRSA has been described as clinically \\nindistinguishable from CA MRSA pneumonia containing PVL, both organisms affecting \\nyoun g individuals and are associated with multi -lobe presentation, leucopenia, severe \\nprostration, very high mortality and an exceedingly rapid course (30).', 'While previous reports \\nsuggested that MSSA pneumonia should never be treated with vancomycin as the mor tality of \\nthis disease is very high with this treatment (50%) and that beta -lactam antibiotics are the \\npreferable agents in MSSA pneumonia (31, 32 ), in recent years there is some change in this \\nposition.', 'That is, vancomycin is still not indicated for such  MSSA patients but new data \\nsuggest that such patients may benefit from combination therapy of beta -lactam antibiotic in \\ncombination with linezolid or clindamycin or rifampin, or conversely be treated with linezolid \\nor clindamycin alone (33,34, 35,36). Furthermore, lin ezolid, clindamycin and rifampin reduce the in vitro production of PVL \\ncompared to non treated S.', 'Other investigators believe that PVL has no decisive role in  \\nthe pathogenesis and other staphylococcal toxigenic factors like superantigens, α - toxin, \\nhemolysins, enterotoxins, phenol soluble protein (PSM), δ -toxin, and the A gr system ( the \\noperon that regulates gene expression) are more important or equally important to the PVL in \\ncausing the extensive damage to the lungs seen in such cases (40,41, 42). aureus of the MSSA type responsible for the infection that addition of \\nlinezolid or clindamycin should be considered as first line therapy.', 'In beta -lactam allergic \\nindividuals, consideration should be given to the use of linez olid as a single agent, or, in the \\nfuture telavancin. Pneumonia Caused by Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  \\n \\nMRSA pneumonia needs to be divided into Community originating CAP caused by CA \\nMRSA, particularly the strain USA 300 and nosocomial pne umonia causing HAP and VAP. The organisms causing the disease are equipped with a variety of enzymes and toxins to cause \\na rapid irreversible damage of the alveolar epithel ial cells.', 'It is therefore advisable to use in \\nsuch instances antibiotics that in addition to their antimicrobial properties might antagonize or \\ndiminish toxin production or secretion from the bacterial cells. Classically, clindamycin has \\nbeen recommended for such purposes both in streptococcal and staphylococcal infections and \\nwas recently shown to inhibit PVL production (37 -39).', 'Clindamycin \\ndoes not uniquely possess this activity, but also rifampin and linezolid have been shown to \\nhave such anti -PVL properties, this may account for additional isolated case reports favouring \\nthe use of these agents or vancomycin and other glycopeptides in CA MRSA causing CAP, \\nparticularly in younger individuals and un children who are desperately sick (36,43, 44 ,45). HAP and VAP are often caused by MRSA in conjunction with Gram -negative pathogens, \\nfrequently with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to conventional antibiotics.', 'Thus the \\nclinical outcome relies on an appropriate combinatio n of effective anti MRSA agents in \\ncombination with effective Gram -negative coverage. Numerous clinical trials comparing \\nvarious antibiotics active against MRSA failed to show statistically significant superiority of \\nany agent over vancomycin in both HAP a nd VAP. Agents studied recently include: \\nceftobiprole, oritavancin, telavancin tigecycline iclaprim  and linezolid (45, 46, 47 ,48, 49, 50 \\n). Several trials however demonstrated numerical superiority over vancomycin in various \\nsubsets of patients.', 'Options would include telavancin which showed superiority over \\nvancomycin in subset of patients with elevated vancomycin MIC‟s (47)  or linezolid or \\ntigecycline. There is no place for combination therapy against MRSA in HAP and VAP as the \\nresults of single agents are satisfactory.', 'This new application route allows for the delivery of very high drug concentrations deep into \\nthe lung with the hope to overcome resistance, to deliver high drug concentrations into \\ninfected areas overcoming the antagonistic impact of pus, low pH, white cell break products \\netc‟ which impair the antibacterial activity o f many antibiotics that reach the lungs following \\nsystemic administration.', 'Early experiences with intrattracheal amikacin, intratracheal \\naztreonam ,intratracheal polymyxin and intratracheal fluoroquinolones are encouraging \\nalthough most are aimed at Gram -negative pathogens. Duration and Modification of Therapy  \\n \\nBecause unnecessarily broad -spectrum antibiotic therapy promotes the emergence of \\nresistant organisms in individual patients and the environment, modification of the initial \\nbroad -spectrum antibiot ic regimen administered empirically to patients with HCAP, HAP, \\nand VAP using a de -escalation strategy should occur when possible.', 'As a result, presently the duration of therapy for nonbacteremic \\nMRSA should be based on cl inical judgment; most investigators would provide a minimum \\nof 10 -14 days of therapy. For patients with bacteremic MRSA pneumonia, duration of therapy \\nmust take into consideration the potential for complicated bacteremia with metastatic foci of \\ninfection ( endocarditis and osteomyelitis ),   necessitaiting a more prolonged course of \\nantibiotic therapy.', 'Recent reports document an increase in the frequency of SA pneumonia and the spread of \\nCA-MRSA has been accompanied by a rise in the incidence of severe pneumonia attributed to \\nthis pathogen. The current guidelines do not reflect the significant role that SA has in CAP \\ncomplicating influenza and the limited recommended diagnostic tests for CAP will frequently \\nfail to identify this organism. The ensuing antimicrobial therapy recommended by the same \\nguidelines frequently does not provide coverage for this etiologic agent.', 'It is therefore high \\nindex of suspicion that is relied upon for making the d iagnosis of SA and for institution of \\nantimicrobial therapy that provides coverage for CA -MRSA. Duration of hypotension before initiation of \\neffective antimicrobial therapy is the critical determinant of survival in human septic \\nshock.

Thus, Wang and colleagues \\nusing Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry found generally higher plasma SAM \\nlevels than those reported before [10 3].', 'Indeed, the concern needs \\nto be further explored because fasting  status, dietary  intake  of methionine , and other \\nmedications can affect plasma SAM concentration [10 3]. jirovecii have genes  that encoded SAM \\nsynthetase (Sam1) [ 104]. Such data \\nsuggest strongly that the Pneumocystis species  do not depend on an exogenous source of \\nSAM to survive [ 104].

The implementation of o ther complementary studies or \\neven CXR in series  (Figure 3) is normally reserved for  cases of difficult interpretation, \\ncomplications  or unsatisfactory  outcome. In a previous study (3A and 3B), a multicystic \\nlesion on posterior left segments was observed (asterisk).', 'A consolidation  that lasts more than two months is  \\nconsidered to be a slow resolution  and an expl anation should be sought for what could be the \\nunderlying cause for example, congen ital malformation or neoplasm  among others (Figure 4) \\n(2). Those in which pneumonia  is preceded by pharyngitis , laryngitis  and trac heobr onchitis \\nsymptoms  takinginto account the viral etiology ,  \\n2. Viral pneumonia  is the leading cause of respiratory tract infections in the community  and \\nusually resolves spontaneously(2).', 'Instead, we find that a close examination of  the radiolog ical pattern of the pneumonia in \\nquestion is a more practical way to discover the  organism  which is responsible for  the \\nproblem. Faced with a lobar radiogr aphic pattern, we need to ascertain  if the patient has  recently \\nsuffered  a viral or upper respiratory tract infection  and if  on the other hand,  the radiological \\npatte rn is predominantly basal and associated with large pleural ef fusion  or empyema  we \\nwould be looking at  the typical radiological pattern  of Streptococcus pyogenes.', 'However, in  up to \\n10-39% of cases  the CXR may be normal(3,4) (Figure 2 0). This microorganism  produces \\npneumonia  in 60% of patients with AIDS  and is responsible for more than a third of the \\ndeaths  in this population(5). A discussion of  tuberculosis  (TB)  pneumonia  with regard to this group is necessary \\nbecause, although it may occur in immuncompetent  individuals , its incidence  is up to 200 -500 \\ntimes higher in HIV -positive patients(1). In about 30-60% of patients \\nthe presence of lymph adenopathy  can be seen seen o n CXR(1).', 'Finall y, it should be \\nremember ed that low immunedepression  is not a necessary condition for the revival of \\nprevious TB in AIDS  patients, unlike the  case of primary tuberculous infection that  does \\nrequire  a heightened state  of immunosup pression. 146 \\nTo conclude we can affirm that  once we have analyzed the clinical context and \\nunderstood its implications, the observed radiological patterns will be of vital importance in \\nthe diagnosis of each case, something which is fundamental for the correct management  and \\ntreatment  of these patients.', 'Morens et al.

Contents  \\n \\n \\nPreface   vii \\nChapter I  Pneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumonia  1 \\nEnrique J. This new book \\nstudies the symptoms , diagn oses and treatment  of pneumonia. Chapter I – Pneumocystis jirovecii  (formerly  Pneumocystis carinii sp. hominis ) is an \\nunusual  fungus  exhibiting pulmonary tropism  and a highly defined host  specificit y.', 'It is \\ngenerally regarded as an opportunistic microorganism  causing severe and often fatal \\npneumonia  in AIDS  patients. These metho ds are \\nuseful when the organism  burden is relatively high but they are insufficient for reliable \\ndetection  when there is a small parasite  load. However, their c linical relevance  on treatment  failure has not yet been determined. Looming on the horizon is \\nthe specter of resistance to co-trimoxazole and atovaquone, but there are few options for other \\nalternative treatments.', 'Chapter II – Pneumonia is one of the most common serious infections, causing two \\nmillion deaths annually among young children in low-income countries. It is the largest killer, \\naccounting for 28 to 34% of all child deaths below five years of age in low income countries \\nand is an important cause of mortality in the elderly in high-income countries. The objective of this review is \\nto summarize evidence for the effectiveness of modes of supportive treatment in patients with \\npneumonia. Since 2000 to 2004 VAP \\nrepresented the 8.', '9 \\nfor the Pediatric Risk of Mortality Score (PRISM) and 13 (class II) for the Therapeutic \\nIntervention Scoring System (TISS). In NICU data we found 7. Because of the huge diseas e burden and the resultant \\nattributable morbidity and mortality, so much importance is given for accurate diagnosis and \\ntreatment  of this condition. Consequently, the diagnosis is \\ndifficult and most often delayed. The lack of a “gold standard” for diagnosis further \\ncompounds  this p roblem.', 'Several treatment \\nstrategies and guidelines  have been recommended by expert panels for appropriate treatment \\nof these patients without contributing to development of drug resistance. Significant advances \\nhave been made in this field over the past few decades, which will reviewed in this chapter to \\nimprove our understanding of the symptoms of VAP and help us to accu rately diagnosis and \\ntreat this condition. Chapter V – Bacterial  pneumonia  complicating influenza has been recognized at least \\nsince the 19th century.', 'In this setting Staphylococcus aureus  is one of the most common \\noffen ders and is associated with a potentially severe disease accompanied by high rates of \\nmorbidity  and mortality. aureus  pneumonia complicating influenza has accounted for a \\nlarge number of  deaths  [3–6]. 1% of  deaths occurring in these series [7]. Recent data \\nis emerging to suggest an increase in the frequency of SA pneumonia. Possibly the first \\ndocumented cases in North America  were reported by Francis et.', 'CAP was defined as “pneumonia  requiring \\nhospitalization  of an outpatient  not residing in a long -term care facility. Preface  xi \\nChapter VI  – Pulmonary infections still remain the most common infectious cause of \\nmortality  in the world, causing around six million deaths  per year in the United States  where \\nthey are the sixth cause of mortality and an important morbid -mortality source.', \"To \\nguide the clinical diag nosis of pneumonia, establish the  optimal treatment  based on the \\netiological di agnosis and make an adequate follow up of these patients  various diagnostic \\ntests, both invasive and non -invasive , are available to us. Among the complete diagnostic \\nbattery used to the study lung infections  the 'Gold Standard' test is currently the conventional \\nchest radiograph (CXR). So this is the first step that we must take. Within the range of available non -\\ninvasive laboratory tests  we should mention  sputum  and blood culture  or serology  of \\ninfectious agents.\", 'Chapter I  \\n \\n \\nPneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumonia  \\n \\n \\nEnrique J. hominis ) is an unusual  \\nfungus  exhibi ting pulmonary tropism  and a highly defined host  specificity. It is generally \\nregarded as an opportunistic microorganism  causing severe and often fatal pneumonia  in \\nAIDS  patients. These methods are useful when the organism  burden is \\nrelatively high but they are insufficient for reliable detection  when there is a small \\nparasite load. 2 \\nHowever, their clinical relevance  on treatment  failure has not yet been determined.', 'Looming \\non the horizon is the specter  of resistance  to co -trimoxazole and atovaquone, but there are \\nfew options for other alternative treatments. hominis  [1], is an \\natypical fungus  exhibiting pulmonary tropism  and a highly defined host  specificity. carinii  has been regarded  as a single protozoan organism  capable  \\nof infecting a wide variety of animal species  [3]. This  idea lasted unt il 1988 when DNA  \\nstudies were able to identify it as an atypical fungus  close to the family of Aschomycetos  [4].', 'These findings have recently determined the modification of \\nthe nomenclature of Pneumocystis  that colonize and cause infection in humans, formerly \\nknown as P. carinii  to the cause of infection in rats. The mature cysts cont ain eight intracystic nuclei  (figure 1). The trophic forms attach to the alveolar epithelium  trough interdigitation of their \\nmembranes. An alveolar capillary  \\nvessel was indicated (star). Pneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumo nia 5 \\nfully formed. While such findings are suggestive, they are not diagnostic.', 'Laboratory Diagnosis of PCP \\n \\n \\nMicroscopic Detection o f Pneumocystis  \\n \\nP. A mature cyst  \\ncontaining many spores is quite visible (arrowhead). An alveolar macrophage  may also be observed (top right). It is generally accepted, however, that association of methods that stain \\nthe cystic cell wall (e.

Another difficulty relate s to the kind of patients. There is no formal agreement about an unequivocal definition of Pneumocystis \\ncolonization. The notion may however be characterized by clinical and exper imental \\nobservations. Most polymorphism  studies targeted mutations  of the P.', 'These findings strengthened  the idea of using plasma SAM levels as a non -\\ninvasive PcP diagnostic method. However, recent data showed that SAM -related issue s could \\nbe more complex than previously thought. Firstly, differences in SAM levels between \\nlaboratories could be  influenced by the method of measurement. Patients generally \\nimproved after 4 to 8 days of therapy. Patients with reasonable  functional \\nstatus and severe Pc P should be offered ICU admissi on or mechanical ventilation  [112].', 'Regarding which agent is preferred for the  second line of choice , data are \\nlimited ( table 3). This drug inhibits metabolism  of P amino  benzoic acid , interferes with anaerobic glyc olysis , \\ninhibits oxidative phosphorylation , and impairs nucleic acid  and protein synthesis. It was the \\nfirst drug reported to treat PcP successfully and subsequent re ports have confirmed the \\nefficacy of intravenous pentamidine. Dapsone must be taken with TMP [ 127]. This drug was developed clinically in the 1990s and \\nit is available only as oral agent.', 'It is used as a second -line agent for treatment  of mild to \\nmoderate PcP  if TMP -SMX cannot be used. Disadvantages are its high cost  and its bioavailability , \\nalthough it has been improved with the micro nized suspension formulation [ 128]. This drug is \\neffective for treating PcP but is available only in an intravenous formulation. 5  mg/kg) administered every 6 hours. Recommended dose s are shown  in table 3. This mode of action \\ncontrast s with a typical antifungal, which target s the cell membrane.', 'However, this promising therapeutic approach needs to be assessed by controlled clinical \\ntrials. Prognosis  \\n \\nDespite treatment , mortality  from PcP still remains high. Prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the CD4 \\ncell count decreases to less than 2 00 cells/mm3. Prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the \\nCD4 count decreases again to less tha n 200 cel ls/mm3.

Databases searched included MEDLINE and PUBMED and the Cochrane \\nLibrary. To understand the rationale of use of supportive treatment research explaining the \\nmechanisms of effect of the investigated interventions is also des cribed.', 'It was not until the beginnings of the 20th century  when due to wo rks of Haldane, \\nBarcroft and others, oxygen  therapy  was placed on a rational, scientific basis. The modern era of \\noxygen therapy began after World War I. He described many physiological details and was also aware \\nof possible side effects  of providing p ure oxygen inhalations (Haldane 1917). He also developed equipment  for a cheap and \\nefficient way of providing oxygen to patients. The same year Meltzer published a paper \\ndiscussing the therapeutic value of oxygen delivered under positive pressure  (Meltzer 1917).', 'Subsequent works of Haldane, Barcroft and others at that time gave scientific background to \\nthe physiological role of oxygen and its therapeutic use  in current medicine. History of Oxygen use in Pneumonia  \\n \\nThe first report about use of oxygen  in patients suffering with pneumonia  was published  \\nin 1887. The first experimental data about use of oxygen  in animals with laboratory evoked \\npneumonia  were published by Binger in 1928. This was the first \\nexperimental observation suggesting a beneficial role of oxygen therapy  in decreasing \\nmortality  in pneumonia.', 'In 1927 Prendergast compared medical  use and costs of nasal tubes, Haldane masks and \\noxygen  chambers as different methods of oxygen administration to pneumonia  sufferers and \\nsuggested that nasal tube “is perhaps the best of them for general use” (Prendergast 1927). During the 2nd World War a new era of pneumonia  treatment  started with the discovery  \\nof penicillin. Michael Eisenhut and Tomasz Rajkowski  40 \\noxygen concentrators were developed enabling wider use of oxygen in medicine. At the same \\ntime delivery methods of  oxygen, other that through inhalation, were abandoned.', 'Below we \\npresent a review of the current evidence  for use of oxygen in patients with pneumonia. The \\nmajority  of available data are from studies in the paediatric popu lation. The author concluded that in view of above \\nfindings efforts should be made to improve the detection  of hypoxemia and to provide oxygen  \\nearlier to more children with severe acute lower respiratory tract infection s. Even more \\nstriking results come from another prospective cohort study in Gambia (Usen 1999). They \\nobserve d reduction in mortality from 4.', 'This is because any study in which some hypoxic \\npatients are deprived of oxygen therapy would be considered unethical (Dyke 1994). The latter, due to its simplicity and non invasive character, is used as a gold \\nstandard in assessment  of hypoxemia  (Royas -Reyes 2009, Duke 2008). The cut off values therefore had to be determined by \\nstudying healthy children from the same population. Moreover in low income  countries where health  resources  are \\nlimited pulse oximeters may not be available.', 'Inability to drink was assessed as “related” to mortality and in view of little \\ndata relationship to hypoxemia w as not assessed. As methodology  leading to these conclusions is not presented in this paper it is \\nnot possible to critically review these data. Interesting data about tachypnoea \\ncame from one of the analyzed observational studies of 423 children living at an altitude of \\n3750 m in the Peruvian Andes who had acu te respiratory infections (Reuland 1991).', 'Authors suggested that case management  algorithms \\ndeveloped in low -altitude regions may have to be modified for high -altitude settings. Tachypnoea, grunting in young infants and severe chest in -drawing  are parameters \\nsuggested by the WHO as an indicators for oxygen therapy (WHO 1993).

Comparison of Different Methods of Oxygen Delivery  \\n \\nIn the hospital setting oxygen  can be delivered to the patient by nasal cannulas, head box \\nor face mask.', 'Children \\nwere assigned to receive oxygen administer ed by all four methods for 15 minutes in a pre -\\ndetermined sequence. Efficacy of oxygen therapy  was assessed by analysis of arterial blood \\ngas and arterial oxygen saturation  (SaO 2). Acceptability  in terms of child comfort was \\nassessed by a tolerance score as perceived by the mother. The head box and nasal \\ncannula were the best t olerated methods for delivery oxygen. Significant side effects  were \\nnot noted.', 'Above data showed that there is currently not enough evidence  to suggest \\nsuperiority of one method of oxygen delivery over another. The Guideli ne Development Group mentioned results of a prospective \\nstudy from Zambia where the risk  of death from pneumonia was significantly increased when \\nhypoxemia was present (Smyth 1998). During oxygen therapy  the \\nchild should have at least 4 hourly observations including oxygen saturation.', '2) Guidelines for the Management of Community Acquired Pneumonia in Adults \\n(British Thoracic Society 2009)  \\n \\nThe guideline stat es that every adult patient with pneumonia  admitted to hospital should \\nreceive appropriate oxygen  therapy.

The \\nmanagement of Pneumocystis pneumonia remains a major challenge for all physicians caring \\nfor immunosuppressed patients.', 'Despite \\navailability of effective antibiotic treatment the mortality remains 6 to 12% in patient s \\nadmitted to hospital with community acquired pneumonia and over 50% in patients admitted \\nto the intensive care unit (figures from the United Kingdom). Supportive treatment explored in patients with pneumonia includes oxygen in a \\nvariety of applications, fluid therapy regimens, chest physiotherapy, steroid treatment, \\ngranulocyte colony stimulating factor treatment, surfactant application and vitamins A, C and \\nD, zinc, protein and calorie supplements.', 'Studies showed that management of patients with \\nmonitoring of oxygen levels and oxygen delivery guided by oxygen saturation levels can \\nreduce hospitalisation. In children four randomised controlled trials compared oxygen \\ndelivery methods and found that nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheters were found to be \\nsimilar in effectiveness and safety. Review of trials, which assessed the accuracy of clinical \\nsigns indicating hypoxemia found that no single clinical sign or symptom accurately \\nidentified hypoxemia.', 'Vitamin C supplementation in critically ill patients was associated with \\nlower mortality and reduced respiratory symptom score in one trial. Use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor application \\nwas not associated with reduction of mortality in a meta-analysis of 6 studies. Trials using supplementation with zinc did not show consistent benefit. For fluid \\nregimes, chest physiotherapy, vitamin D and protein and calorie supplements there has been a \\nlack of evidence for an influence on outcome and further research is required.', 'In spite of the fact that its incidence  is higher in \\nadult patient‟s intensive care unit, VAP is associated with increased morbidity , length of \\nPICU and NICU stay, antibiotic  use and costs also in pediatric population. The lack of a gold \\nstandard for the diagnosis of VAP makes an int erpretation of the literature complex, and \\ndifferences in the incidence of VAP occur as a result of the definitions used and people doing \\nthe surveillance.', 'The nosocomial infection preventive measures, principally the hand hygiene  of the \\nhealth -care personne l and visitors, the correct asepsis before invasive procedures, the \\nadequacy of antibiotics policy , and the correct nutrition  of our children  have demonstrated to \\nreduce the risk  of suffering a  hospita l-acquired infection even in 50 %. Chapter IV – Ventilator -associated pneumonia  (VAP) is the most frequent intensive care \\nunit (ICU) -acquired infection , occurring in 6 to 52% of patient s intubated for more than 48 \\nhours.', 'It is associated with high mortality  and morbidity , prolonged lengths of hospitalisation, \\nand also increased cost  of health -care. In the critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation , the clinical \\nsigns  and symptoms  of pneumonia are non -specific and varied. Although many clinical, radiological, microbiological and \\nhistopathological criteria have been suggested by various workers , all of them have certain \\ninherent demerits. The management  of patients with VAP is so ch allenging because of the \\nincreased association of multi -drug resistant organisms with this condition.', 'The r ecent increase in staphylococcal infections caused by \\ncommunity -acqu ired methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (CA-MRSA),  has been \\nincreasingly recognized to be associated with community associated pneumonia (CAP ). This \\ntype of pneumonia  affect s mainly a young er age group, frequently follows i nfection  with \\ninfluenza, and is often severe, requiring hospitalization  and causing deat h in a significant \\nproportion of those affected.', 'Recognizing the role of Staphylococcus aureus  in general and \\nCA-MRSA in parti cular as important causes of pneumonia after influenza infection may \\ndecrease the delay before the institution of appropriate antimicrobial therapy , which in turn \\nshould contribute to improved outcome of this severe disease. This article reviews the \\nepidemiology , clinical features, diagnosis, and therapies for staphylococcal pneumonia \\ncomplicating influenza virus  infection. Reports of bacterial co -infection of influenza increased from 6%  in 2004 –2005 , to 15% in \\n2005 -2006 and to 34% in 2006 –2007.', 'S aureus  was isolated from a sterile site o r from the \\nendotracheal tube in 1 case in 2004 –2005, from 3 cases in 2005 –2006, and from 22 cases in \\n2006 –2007. A survey of 59 US hospitals involving 4543 \\npatients with culture -positive pneumonia between January 2002 and January 2004 [10] \\nidentified MRSA as a potential pathogen in CAP  (8. This report too points to the increased frequency and severity of S A \\npneumonia complicating viral pneumonia.', 'The CDC  has documented reports from state and local health  departments over the last \\nseveral  influenza seasons describing previously healthy  children  with a severe s. The \\nmagnitude of the risk  depends on the particular strain of influenza virus  and the degree of \\nlocal epithelial damage and immune dysregulation the viral infection  induces as well as on the \\nvirulence and antibiotic  susceptibility  of the ensuing SA strains.', 'When the authors  \\nfind a patient presenting fever , cough , tachy pnea , and rales  on auscultation  a clinical \\ndiagnosis  of infectious  pneumonia should be considered  although  at the same time we know  \\nthat there are  certain pathologies that can clinically mimic the presence of pneumonia. In fact, the American Thorac ic Society recommends the prac tice of a \\nCXR, including posterior/ anterior and lateral projectionsfor an adult with suspected \\npneumonia.', 'If there is no clinical -radiological correlation  or we find complications  or \\nabnormal evolution  of the infection  we can carry out Computed Tomography (CT) or other \\nuseful procedures for the management  of the pneumonia. On the invasive side we  can use transtracheal aspiration , thoracentesis , \\nclosed pleural biopsy , bronchosco py with aspiration and brushing, transbronchial biopsy, \\npercutaneous aspiration and open pulmonary or pleural biopsies.', 'However, with the currently rising number of patients receiving \\nimmunosuppressive therapies  for malignancies, allogeneic organ  transplantations and \\nautoimmune diseases , Pneumocystis  pneumonia is becoming more and more recognized \\nin non -HIV immunosuppressed individuals. The clinical presentation  in HIV -infected \\npatients may differ from that in other immunocompromis ed patients and its diagnosis \\ncontinues to be challenging because no combination of symptoms , signs , blood  \\nchemistries, or radiographic findings is specific of Pneumocystis  pneumonia.', 'jirovecii  cannot be grown in culture  from clinical specimens, the diagnosis of \\nPneumocystis  pneumonia continues to rely on the microscopic demonstration of the \\ncharacteristic organisms using conventional cytochemical or im munofluorescence \\nstaining in respiratory samples.

The management  of Pneumocystis pneumonia \\nremains a major challenge for all physicians  caring for immuno suppressed patients. This \\nmicroorganism  causes opportunistic infection , particularly pneumonia , in patients who have \\nimpaired immunity. The general term for clinical disease c aused by Pneumocystis  is \\npneumocystosis.', 'Pneumocytsis  was originally identified in 1909 by Carlos Chagas in the lungs of guinea \\npigs that were inoculated with the blood  of trypanomiasis patients. One year later, \\nAntonio Carini made a similar description in the lungs of rats infected by Trypanosoma \\nlewisi.', 'For se ven decades, most investigators thought Pneumocystis organisms to be protozoans \\nbecause they do not look much like fungi  base on the histological characteristics of its \\ntrophozoite and cyst  life forms, fail to grow m uch in culture , and are not eliminated from \\npatients by treatment  with the usual antifungal agents. By contrast, drugs , such as \\ntrimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, which are often useful in treatin g protozoan \\ninfections, are also active against Pneumocystis.', 'Subsequent studies using molecular techniques  allowed knowing other aspects, as it is a \\nubiquitou s fungus with pulmonary tropism , which colonizes only mammals  and that have a \\nhigh specificity for the host  (stenoxenism). Therefore, human  pneumocystosis is \\nnot a zoonotic disease, and this notion has impor tant implications for the epidemiology  of \\nhuman -derived Pneumocystis. Pneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumo nia 3 \\nPneumocystis  is generally regarded as an opportunistic microorganism  causing serious \\npneumonia  in immunocompromised  patients, especially in those with AIDS.', 'However, \\nPneumocystis  was first identified as a human -pathogen in premature or malnourished infants  \\nsuffering from inte rstitial plasma cell pneumonia in European countries around World War I I, \\noccasionally occurring in epidemics [2,3]. During the 1990s , the introduction \\nof highly active antiretroviral therapy  (HAART ) for HIV infection  and Pneumocystis  \\nchemoprophylaxis reduced the frequency of PcP.', 'Although at the beginning  of th is century, \\nthe incidence  of pneumonia caused by this microorganism among subjects with HIV infection \\nhas decreased in developed countries , the prevalence of AIDS -related PcP in developing \\ncountries  remains high and poorly controlled. jirovecii infection  goes beyond AIDS  patients since with the \\nrising number of patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies  for autoimmune diseases , \\nmalignancies, allogeneic bone  marrow  or solid organ  transplantations, PcP is more and more \\nrecognized in non -HIV immunosuppressed patients  [5,6,8].', 'Underlying conditions associated \\nwith PcP in HIV -negative patients include hematologic or solid malign ancies, allograft \\ntransplantation , autoimmune inflammatory disorders (mainly Wegener granulomatosis and \\nsystemic lupus erythematosus ), inflammatory bowel disease , protein -calorie  malnutrition , and \\ncongenital immunodeficiency  disorders [5 ,6,8-12]. Lately, PcP has been reported in patients \\nundergone treatment  with new biological tumor  necrosis factor -alpha antagonist  agents \\n(adalimumab , infliximab , etanercept ) and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , rituximab  [13-16].', 'On the other hand, few treatment  options exist for \\npatients with PcP. Thus, m anagement  of PcP remains a major challenge  to all physicians  \\ncaring for these patients. Many investigators have attempted to \\ncultivate Pneumocystis  using a variety of techniques , but have had limited success, impeding \\nstudies of Pneumocystis. Pneumonia models  in immune -suppressed animals remain the main \\nsource of organisms for laboratory studies , yet these  approaches have numerous inherent \\ndifficulties.', 'All stages are found in lungs but the trophozoite stage is the vegetative state  that \\npredomin ates over the cystic form during infection  by approximately 10:1. During infection, \\nmost trophic forms are haploid  and it has been hypothesized that trophic forms can conjugate \\nand develop into cysts. It has been \\nsuggested that trophic forms originate from the intracystic nuclei of the mature  cyst as its \\nruptures and then undergo vegetative growth  or conjugation  to re -form the cysts forms.', 'It  is \\nfurther proposed that they may also undergo asexual reproduction  through haploid mitosis  \\nand binary fission. In an infected host , Pneumocystis  exists almost exclusively within lung \\nalveoli. This adherence is characterized by close apposition of the cel l surface  without \\nfusion  of the membranes and strongly promotes proliferation  of the organism. Pneumocystis  \\nmaintains an extracellular existence within alveoli, and probably obtains  essential nutrients  \\nfrom the alveolar fluid  or living cells.', 'The adherence of Pneumocystis  also inhibits the growth \\nof lung epithelial cells. Although organism attachment  to alveo li epithelial cells is essential \\nfor Pneumocystis  infection and propagation , invasion of host cells is uncommon and \\nextrapulmonary pneumocystosis occurs only in the setting of severe immunosuppression. Mononuclear thin -\\nwalled trophic forms (small arrows) are attached to type 1 epithelial alveolar cells. While an electron -lucent layer develops in \\nintermediate sporocytes, mitotic nuclear divisions proceed.', 'An additional mitotic replication  leads to a thick -\\nwalled late spor ocyte containing eight haploid  (n) nuclei. These forms are able to leave the cyst and subsequently attach to type I alveolar cells. However, the clinical picture in individual patients is variable and many \\ninfectious and non -infectious processes can present identically. In patients infected with HIV , PcP  is a common AIDS -defining illness and occurs most \\nfrequently in subjects with a CD4+ count less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter.', 'Non-HIV immunosuppressed patients usually have a more rapid onset than those infected \\nwith HIV. PcP usually has a subacute  presentation with more insidious involvement in \\npatients with HIV infection  than in non -HIV immunosuppressed patients where PcP is much \\nmore likely to be an acute illness causing severe respiratory distress  that frequently require s \\nmechanical v entilation  within the first several days [2 3,24]. In children , the symptoms  of PcP \\ncan often be quite subtle, with an increased respiratory rate  heralding the first s ign of \\nrespiratory tract involvement.', 'In all cases, a high index of suspicion and a thorough history  are key factors in early \\ndetection  of PcP. Lung auscultation  usually reveals few abnormalities with dry cackles or rhonchi  present in \\nless than 50% of patients. Individuals with PcP can be hypoxemic with respiratory alkalos is \\nbut can also have normal alveolar -arterial gradients if identified early in the natural history of \\ntheir disease. Elevated serum  levels of lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH) have been related with \\nPcP and probably reflects lung parenchymal damage but is not specific.', 'However, almost every conceivable radiographic presentation has been linked to PcP, \\nincluding asymmetrical infiltrates, nodular densities, cavitary lesions , lymphadenopaties, \\npleural effusion s, pneumatocele s, and pneumothorax. Patients who receive aerosolized \\npentamidine have an increased frequency of upper -lobe infiltrates , pneumothorax, or cystic \\nlesions. However, a negative high -resolution computed tomography scan may allow exclusion  of PcP \\nin such patients.', 'Pneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumo nia 7 \\nImmunorestitution disease (IRD) is defined as an acute symptomatic or paradoxical \\ndeterioration of a (most probably) preexisting infection  that is temporally related to the \\nrecovery  of the immune system  and it is due to immunopathological damage associated with \\nthe reversal of immunosuppressive processes. PcP manifesting as a form of IRD has been \\ndescribed in both HIV  and non -HIV immunosuppressed patients [2 8-30].', 'In non -HIV immunosuppressed patients , the clinical symptoms  of PcP may be unmasked \\nduring the reversal of immunosuppression , often at the time when the dose of steroids  is \\ntapered or when the endogenous steroid production is reduced [3 3,34]. Rapid reduction of \\nimmunosuppressive therapy  has been implicated as a predisposing factor for the development \\nof PcP in non -HIV immunosuppressed patients. In this group of patients, PcP manifesting as \\nIRD often runs an acute and fulminant course, with nonspecific lesions  on chest radiographs \\nand high lymphocyte counts.', 'jirovecii  infection  (extrapulmonary \\npneumocystosis) are distinctly unusual. Extrapulmonary pneumocystosis has been reported \\nprimarily amon g HIV -infected patients, particularly those who receive aerosolized \\npentamidine for prophylaxis  of PcP. Mainly, during the terminal stage of HIV -related disease \\nPneumocystis  organisms may disseminate from the lungs to other organs  where they induce \\nsecondary visceral lesions. However, at times  pulmonary infection may not be apparent when \\nextrapulmonary lesions are detected.', 'For HIV -infected patients, extrapulmonary \\npneumocystosis limited to the choroid  layer or ear (external auditory canal or middle ear) has \\na better prognosis , with good response  to specific treatment , than disseminated \\npneumocystosis in multiple noncontiguous s ites. Disseminated pneumocystosis is usually \\nclinically evident, with symptoms  related to the affected organs. Non -HIV-associated extrapulmonary pneumocystosis has been rarely reported.', 'In all cases, the clinical diagnosis  is complicated because no combination of symptoms , \\nsigns , blood  chemistries, or radiographic findings is specific of  Pneumocystis  infection. As \\nsuch, identification  of Pneumocystis organisms or its DNA  in a clinically relevant sample is \\nrequired to make a diagnosis. 8 \\nDiagnosis  \\n \\nThe single most important diagnostic t ool for Pneumocystis  infection  is a high clinical \\nsuspicion.', 'In the right clinical setting, an immunosuppressed patient with new onset of \\ndyspnea  or new symptoms  of pneumonia , with or wit hout radiological findings, should \\nprompt further evaluation, particularly if they are not receiving chemoprophylaxis. jirovecii organisms are usually detected in broncho alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), \\ninduced sputum  (IS) samples , or lung biopsy  specimens by means of light  microscopy  (figure \\n3), immunofluorescence , or molecular methods. No in vitro system for obtaining routinely \\nPneumocystis  isolates from patients is available.', 'Using light microscopy, parasites , especially \\nmature cysts, can be detected using phase contrast or Nomarski interference  contrast on wet \\nsmears. The cell wall of cystic and sporocytic forms appears as a \\nclear, thin peripheral halo. TBO or GMS stains facilitate rapid parasite  detection , even at low magnification, in  all \\nkinds of clinical specimens. However, these dyes  also stain the cell wall of yeasts or other \\nfungi.', 'In \\nfact, Giemsa and other stains with similar cytological affinities, such as Diff Quick or RAL -\\n555, cause the parasite nuclei  to stain pinkish purple and the cytoplasm  to stain blue [40,41]. They do not stain cystic or sporocytic walls, which appear like a clear peripheral halo around \\ncystic form s. These polychrome stains make it possible accurately to distinguish \\nPneumocystis trophic or cystic forms from other fungi and also from host  cells or cell debris.', 'In order to detect Pneumocystis organisms in histological sections from lung or other \\norgans , pathologists targ et usually the cystic forms, since trophic ones are uneasily \\nidentifiable in paraffin -embedded tissues. Therefore, t hey use GMS and, less frequently, TBO \\nstaining procedures adapted to tissue  sections. Moreover, PCR assays followed by direct sequencing  or other strategies were used \\nfor typing Pneumocysti s isolates in order to identify parasite strains and to explore correlation  \\nbetween specific genotypes and virulence, transmissibility or drug susceptibility.', 'PCR, \\nespecially nested PCR  assays a pplied to noninvasive samples, have also been used to detect \\nPneumocystis colonization  either in susceptible individuals  or in apparently healthy people, \\nincluding healthcare staffs in hospitals [5 5,58,59 ].', 'For Pc P diagnosis in humans, conventional or real -time PCR  assays based on the \\namplification of the large subunit of mitochondr ial ribosomal DNA  (mtLSUrDNA) [51,60 ] \\nare the most commonly used, but many other sequences have been targeted ( Major Surface \\nGlycoprotein, Internal Transcribed Spacers, Thymidylate Synthase, Dihydrofolate Reductase, \\nheat-shock  protein 70, etc. In general, conventional , or real -time Pneumocystis PCR  assays , have represented a \\nsignificant advance in PcP laboratory diagnosis.', 'Pneumocystis  jirovecii  Pneumo nia 13 \\naccurate, early diagnosis of Pneumocystis  infection  [54], which should lead to a decreased \\nduration from onset of symptoms  to treatment. In addition, PCR assay  may reveal PcP in patients with negative \\nmicroscopic test.

Thus, a quantitative real -time PCR assay that targeted the Pneumocystis \\nMajor Surface Glycoprotein (MSG) multigene family was applied to OW samples, and \\nrevealed significant differences between PcP patients an d Pneumocystis colonized subjects in \\nthe number of MSG copies.', 'Actually, it seems \\ndifficult to apply the same cutoff to AIDS  patients, patients with other underlying diseases , or \\nindividuals  receiving  chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of Pneumocystis colonization or subclinical \\ncarriage is usually retained when Pneumocystis DNA  is detected by PCR  methods in \\nrespiratory samples from immunodepressed or immun ocompetent subjects without symptoms  \\nor signs  of Pneumocystis infection , and who do not progress to PcP [7 2].', 'jirovecii  dihydropteroate \\nsynthase (DHPS) gene, which could potentia lly be linked with sulfa resistance. jirovecii culture  systems are unavailable, several groups have \\nassessed putative trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole drug resistance  by detecting Pneumocystis \\nDHPS mutations.

Serum BG appeared therefore as a good marker of Pneumocystis infection. In a recent study, it has b een observed that BG levels in non -HIV patients with PcP are \\nlower than in HIV patients.', 'These preliminary studies suggest that in the right clinical setting serum  BG may provide \\na useful noninvasive diagnostic adjunct for patients with Pneumocystis  infection.

Management Strategies f or PCP \\n \\nThere is no universally agreed approach on the initial management  of patients with \\nsuspected PcP.', 'In AIDS -related PcP, the typical duration of therapy  is at least 21 days because of \\nthe risk  for relaps e with shorter treatment duration. In the absence of corticosteroid therapy , early and \\nreversible deterioration within the first 3 –5 days of therapy is typical.', 'Because of the potential for additive or synergistic toxicities associated with anti -\\nPneumocystis  and antiretroviral therapies, certain health -care providers delay initiation  of \\nHAART  until after the completion of anti -Pneumocystis  therapy , or until at least 2 weeks \\nafter initiating anti -Pneumocystis  therapy, despite some suggestion of  potential benefit of \\nearly HAART in the treatment  of pat ients with AIDS -related opportunistic infections \\n[112,116 ].', 'In order to correct ly manage  PcP, it is important to distinguish between \\nprogressive PcP, drug toxicity , and concomitant infection  if clinical deterioration is detected. T MP inhibits \\ndihydrofolate reductase and SMX  inhibits dihydrotperoate synthetase. The recommended dose of \\nTMP -SMX for adults  (or children  aged > 2 months) is 15 to 20 mg/kg/day of TMP and 75 to \\n100 mg/kg/ day of SMX intravenously  every 6 or 8 hours.

Variability of the Symptoms and Signs of VAP \\n \\nThe systemic symptoms  and signs  of VAP are often non -specific, f or instance, fever  and \\nleukocytosis  can be caused by any condition that releases cytokines  like, interleukin -1, \\ninterleukin -6, tumor  necrosis factor  alpha, and  gamma interferon  [15,16 ].', 'Trauma, surgery, \\ndeep vein  thrombosis , pancreatitis , pulmonary embolism , pulmonary edema , and pulmonary \\ninfarction  are conditions that are often associated with fever and leukocytosis, as they induce \\ncytokine release as an inflammatory response  [15,16 ]. The presence of asymmetric pulmonary infiltrates on chest  radiograph  consistent with \\nVAP may be caused by various non -infectious conditions.', 'Atelectasis, emphysema , \\nasymmetric cardio -pulmonary edema , pulmonary contus ion, pulmonary hemorrhage , \\npulmonary embolism , chemical pneumonitis  and drug reaction may often show radiographic \\nfindings similar to that of VAP , challenging the accurate diagnosis of VAP [15,16,19 ]. However, studies have shown that certain chest radiograph  findings,  like \\nprogressive rapid cavitation of the pulmonary infiltrate, an air space process abutting a fissure \\nand a single air bronchogram were associated with 96% specificity for diagnosing VAP and \\ntherefore can be reliably used.', 'The \\ninterplay of various factors such as the altered immune response s in critically ill patients,  \\npresence of underlying conditions, intake of corticosteroids  and anti -inflammatory agents , \\nmakes the diagnosis of VAP so difficult. Clinical Diagnosis  \\n \\nThe clinical assessment  of VAP is usually based on presence of fever  (temperature  \\n>38. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis  of VAP was made  using a combination of these signs  \\nand symptoms.', 'The clinicians routinely suspect VAP when  the patient has a new or \\nprogressive lung infiltrate plus at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: fever , purulent  sputum , or \\nleukocytosi s [18,22,23 ]. As a result clinicians started using multiple criteria  for diagnosing VAP, with \\nemphasize on  certain findings over others. A major problem with the CPIS score proposed by \\nPugin et al is that it requires respiratory tract secretions cultures, thereby delaying the \\ndiagnosis by 24 –48 hours.', 'Nevertheless, Fagon et al  found \\nno significant differences in the accuracy of the clinical suspicion of VAP between either \\nindividual physicians  or physicians grouped by level of training. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC ) has recommended the following criteria for \\nclinically defining pneumonia  in patients on mechanical ventilation.', '2 Microbiological  Diagnosis  \\n \\nThe microbiological diagnosis of VAP is usually based on direct microscopic \\nexamination, qualitative, semi -quantitative and quantitative culture  of lower respiratory tract \\nsecretions obtained bronchos copically or non -bronchoscopically. After \\ncollection of the specimens either bronchoscopically or non -bronchoscopically, the \\npercentages of squamous and bronchial epithelial cells  may be used to predict heavy upper -\\nrespiratory contamination.', 'This study suggests \\nthat the  reliability  of Gram staining is variable, dependent on the result of the Gram staining. Hence, Gram‟s stain is not reliable for the early \\nadaptation  of empirical chemotherapy. Blot et al \\nproposed using Gram stain findings of EA and  of blinded PTC specimens  as an aid for \\ntherapeutic decision -making in suspected VAP cases. 2 Giemsa Staining  \\nGiemsa stain is widely used to determine the percentage  of nucleated cells containing \\nintracellular organi sms (ICOs) per field.', 'In a study, whic h prospectively evaluated  the diagnostic  accuracy of microscopic \\nexamination of non-bronchoscopic protected  bronchoalveolar mini -lavage  (mini-PBAL ) fluid  \\nin comparison with the results  obtained by quantitative cultures, the cutoff point of ≥2% of \\ncells containing ICOs had  the highest sensitivity  (80%) and specificity (82%), a  positive \\npredictive value of 94%, and a negative  predictive value of 52%, with an AUC of 0. The \\ndirect examination of mini -PBAL fluid was found  less accurate  when previous antibiotic \\ntreatment  has been administered.', '3 Culture  \\nThe inaccuracy of the clinical approaches for diagnosis of VAP, the impossibi lity of \\nusing such a strategy to avoid over -prescription  of antibiotics in the intensive care unit  (ICU)  \\nand the need to know the etiological agent and its susceptibility  pattern has led numerous \\ninvestiga tors to postulate “specialized”  culture -based methods  for diagnosis of VAP. It \\nincludes qualitative, semi -quantitative and quantitative cultures of the respiratory secretions \\nobtained bronchoscopically or non -bronchoscopically.', '1 Qualitative Culture  \\nQualitative  culture  is usually performed for endotracheal aspirates. It \\nis widely believed that qualitative culture results may not be very specific and so it cannot be \\nrelied on for treatment  of VAP patients. Therefor e, it was \\nsuggested that use of qualitative culture for deciding on continuation of antibiotic  therapy  \\nmay lead to overtreatment of even patients without VAP and subsequently contribute to \\ndevelopment of drug  resistance.', 'As the sensitivity of \\nquantitative cultures of tracheal  aspirates was significantly lower than th at of qualitative \\ncultures for VAP diagnosis , the  use of quantitative culture  alone may result in under -\\ndiagnosis of VAP, leading to inappropriate changes to  antibiotic regimens and, in some cases, \\nantibiotic delay or  withdrawal. Therefore, i n sev erely ill patients  receiving prior antibiotics  \\nquantitative cultures of tracheal aspirates should not  replace qualitative cultures for the \\npurpose of confirming  a clinical diagnosis  of VAP or adjusting antimicrobial  therapy.', '2 Semi -Quantitative Culture  \\nSemi -quantitative cultures are performed by streaking the endotracheal sample s onto \\nstandard culture  media  using  the four -quadrant streak technique. So, guiding therapy  on the basis of semi -quantitative cultures may result in \\nfailure to  identify potentially multiple -drug-resistant pathogens, and would also tend to \\npromote excessive  antibiotic  usage. In earlier  studies using semi -quantitative cultures , presence of “moderate” or “heavy”  \\ngrowth  was considered as diagnostic  threshold for  diagnosing VAP  [30,58,59 ].', 'However, a \\nrecent study  suggested use of light growth as diagnostic threshold , as it was found to have a \\nbetter  agreeme nt with quantitative culture. Due to  the variability in  sensitivity  and specificity of semi -quantitative endotracheal aspirate  \\ncultures and the lack of good scientific data for defin ing a diagnostic threshold that optimizes \\noutcomes, appropriate  antibiotic  selection based on  these culture methods is problematic. Currently, there are not many studies evaluating the use of semi -quantitative cultures for \\ndiagnosis of VAP.', '3 Quantitative Culture  \\nUnlike qualitative and semi -quantitative cultures which are usually performed only for \\nendotracheal aspirates, the quantitative culture  is done for a wide range of specimens. If the number of CFU/ml is equal \\nto or exceeds the threshold values for the particular technique, a diagnosis of pneumoni a is \\nmade. The selection of the lung segment is usually aided by simple chest radiograph , \\nthoracic  computed tomography  scan and/or visualiza tion of purulent secretion  from a specific \\nsegmental bronchus  during  bronchoscopy.', 'Bronchoscopic tracheobronchial secretion  (TBS) is usually aspirated through the working \\nchannel of the  bronchoscope  before performing BAL. For quantitative \\nanalysis, usually the  aspirate  is either mechanically  liquefied and homogenized by vortexing \\nfor 1 min with glass  beads  or mixed with sputolysin  and vortexed  thoroughly. Many studies  have demonstrated that these non -bronchoscopic techniques  can \\nbe considered as equivalent to bronchoscopic  techniques. For performing  non-bronchoscopic BAL, the patient  should initially be placed on 100% \\noxygen.', 'The endotrac heal aspirate  is collected using two catheters wherein a 8 F suction catheter  \\nis guided through the lumen  of a 14 F suction catheter to serve as a telescoping catheter and is \\ngently introduced through the endotracheal tube for approximately 24  cm. As all the three \\nbronchoscopic methods are having a good correlation , any of these sampling techniques  can \\nbe reliably used for diagnosis of VAP. Studies  have also shown  that non -bronchoscopic techniques  are compar able to \\nbronchoscopic  BAL.', 'Considering these potenti al limitations, a quantitative culture that exceeds a \\nthreshold value is not always diagnostic of VAP. The presence of VAP is confirmed  only \\nwhen the histopathological  findings are in accordance with the  quantitative culture result s. Therefore, if the lung  tissue s with the lesions \\nare not sample d, the histo patho logic al diagnosis of pneumonia  may be missed.', 'Epidem iological Investigation of VAP \\n \\nThe epidemiology  of VAP is more complex because of the coexistence of epidemic  cases \\ndue to the ICU strain with unrelated sporadic cases caused by different strains. In that study PCR -RFLP and antibiogram typing were used to \\nidentify the similar strains. Therefore, the molecular typing methods are essential to confirm if the environmental or the \\nhealth  care worker associated microorganism  is responsible for VAP in the ICU patients, so \\nthat control measures  can be implemented to prevent new cases of VAP.', 'Treatment  \\n \\nThe succe ssful treatment  of patients with VAP remains a challenge for critical care \\nphysicians  as it is influenced by diverse factors including  lack of definitive diagnosis of VAP, \\nlack of an adequate technique / facility  to dire ctly sample the infection  site in the lung,  \\ndifficulty in differentiating active infection from  colonization , and increased occurrence of  \\nMDR pathogens  [7,15,87 ].', 'The initial empiric therapy should be \\nselected based on the presence or absence of risk factors  for MDR pathogens such as \\nprolonged hospitalization , admission from a healthcare -related facil ity, and prior  antibiotic \\ntherapy. A prospective study has \\ndocumented that an initial empiric therapy with antipseudomonal  penicillins plus β-lactamase \\ninhibitor  was associated with  lower in -hospital  mortality.', 'A \\ndifferent class of antibiotic should be used as empiric therapy for patients who have recently \\nreceived an antibiotic, as r ecent therapy predisposes to resistance  to that same class of \\nantibiotics increasing the probability  of inappropriate therapy. Though this strategy has been proved to be effective, there is a practical difficulty in \\ntreating patients with culture  negative BAL despite a high index of clinical suspicio n of VAP.', 'However, randomized clinical trials  \\ninvolving  large number of patients are necessary to establish  the safety  of employing culture -\\nnegative  BAL as  the primary criterion for the  discontinuation of empirical antibiotic  \\ntreatment , as it is well known th at prior antibiotic treatment could result in false negative  \\nBAL culture even in patients with VAP. Despite \\nbeing fully aware of this problem, most cases of VAP are traditionally treated for a period of \\n14 – 21 days.', 'Dennesen et \\nal had shown that during the second week of therapy  Gram -negative pathogens  reemerged \\nand colonize d the trachea. This emphasizes the need to have short \\ncourse of treatment, so that there is no risk  of colonization by drug resistant pathogens. So, the authors \\nsuggested that short -courses are adequate to successfully treat most patients with VAP, but \\nthose infected with non -fermenters should be treated for a prolonged duration.', 'In a recent study , use of nebulized colistin was shown to  be reasonably \\nefficacious and safe for treatment  of MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Acinetobacter \\nbaumannii  with an overall clinical and microbiological response  rates of 57.

Presently therefore, a high level of suspicion is probably the most \\nimportant factor in establishing an early rapid diagnosis.', 'CA-MRSA sh ould be suspected as the cause of CAP in the presence of the following key \\nfeatures: influenza -like prodrome, hemoptysis [24], severe respiratory symptoms, high fever, \\nleukopenia, hypotension, and a chest x -ray showing multilobular infiltrates, with or without \\ncavitation in addition to an appropriate epidemiological background particularly in a patient \\nwith aprecceding skin or soft tissue infection known to be caused by MRSA [11]. Therapy   \\n \\nThe first, and arguably the most important, aspect of treatment is the need  for rapid \\ninstitution of appropriate antibiotic therapy.', 'Pneumonia Caused by Methicillin -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus  \\n \\nPneumonia caused by MSSA strains containing MRSA has been described as clinically \\nindistinguishable from CA MRSA pneumonia containing PVL, both organisms affecting \\nyoun g individuals and are associated with multi -lobe presentation, leucopenia, severe \\nprostration, very high mortality and an exceedingly rapid course (30).', 'While previous reports \\nsuggested that MSSA pneumonia should never be treated with vancomycin as the mor tality of \\nthis disease is very high with this treatment (50%) and that beta -lactam antibiotics are the \\npreferable agents in MSSA pneumonia (31, 32 ), in recent years there is some change in this \\nposition.', 'That is, vancomycin is still not indicated for such  MSSA patients but new data \\nsuggest that such patients may benefit from combination therapy of beta -lactam antibiotic in \\ncombination with linezolid or clindamycin or rifampin, or conversely be treated with linezolid \\nor clindamycin alone (33,34, 35,36). Furthermore, lin ezolid, clindamycin and rifampin reduce the in vitro production of PVL \\ncompared to non treated S.', 'Other investigators believe that PVL has no decisive role in  \\nthe pathogenesis and other staphylococcal toxigenic factors like superantigens, α - toxin, \\nhemolysins, enterotoxins, phenol soluble protein (PSM), δ -toxin, and the A gr system ( the \\noperon that regulates gene expression) are more important or equally important to the PVL in \\ncausing the extensive damage to the lungs seen in such cases (40,41, 42). aureus of the MSSA type responsible for the infection that addition of \\nlinezolid or clindamycin should be considered as first line therapy.', 'In beta -lactam allergic \\nindividuals, consideration should be given to the use of linez olid as a single agent, or, in the \\nfuture telavancin. Pneumonia Caused by Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  \\n \\nMRSA pneumonia needs to be divided into Community originating CAP caused by CA \\nMRSA, particularly the strain USA 300 and nosocomial pne umonia causing HAP and VAP. The organisms causing the disease are equipped with a variety of enzymes and toxins to cause \\na rapid irreversible damage of the alveolar epithel ial cells.', 'It is therefore advisable to use in \\nsuch instances antibiotics that in addition to their antimicrobial properties might antagonize or \\ndiminish toxin production or secretion from the bacterial cells. Classically, clindamycin has \\nbeen recommended for such purposes both in streptococcal and staphylococcal infections and \\nwas recently shown to inhibit PVL production (37 -39).', 'Clindamycin \\ndoes not uniquely possess this activity, but also rifampin and linezolid have been shown to \\nhave such anti -PVL properties, this may account for additional isolated case reports favouring \\nthe use of these agents or vancomycin and other glycopeptides in CA MRSA causing CAP, \\nparticularly in younger individuals and un children who are desperately sick (36,43, 44 ,45). HAP and VAP are often caused by MRSA in conjunction with Gram -negative pathogens, \\nfrequently with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to conventional antibiotics.', 'Thus the \\nclinical outcome relies on an appropriate combinatio n of effective anti MRSA agents in \\ncombination with effective Gram -negative coverage. Numerous clinical trials comparing \\nvarious antibiotics active against MRSA failed to show statistically significant superiority of \\nany agent over vancomycin in both HAP a nd VAP. Agents studied recently include: \\nceftobiprole, oritavancin, telavancin tigecycline iclaprim  and linezolid (45, 46, 47 ,48, 49, 50 \\n). Several trials however demonstrated numerical superiority over vancomycin in various \\nsubsets of patients.', 'Options would include telavancin which showed superiority over \\nvancomycin in subset of patients with elevated vancomycin MIC‟s (47)  or linezolid or \\ntigecycline. There is no place for combination therapy against MRSA in HAP and VAP as the \\nresults of single agents are satisfactory.', 'This new application route allows for the delivery of very high drug concentrations deep into \\nthe lung with the hope to overcome resistance, to deliver high drug concentrations into \\ninfected areas overcoming the antagonistic impact of pus, low pH, white cell break products \\netc‟ which impair the antibacterial activity o f many antibiotics that reach the lungs following \\nsystemic administration.', 'Early experiences with intrattracheal amikacin, intratracheal \\naztreonam ,intratracheal polymyxin and intratracheal fluoroquinolones are encouraging \\nalthough most are aimed at Gram -negative pathogens. Duration and Modification of Therapy  \\n \\nBecause unnecessarily broad -spectrum antibiotic therapy promotes the emergence of \\nresistant organisms in individual patients and the environment, modification of the initial \\nbroad -spectrum antibiot ic regimen administered empirically to patients with HCAP, HAP, \\nand VAP using a de -escalation strategy should occur when possible.', 'As a result, presently the duration of therapy for nonbacteremic \\nMRSA should be based on cl inical judgment; most investigators would provide a minimum \\nof 10 -14 days of therapy. For patients with bacteremic MRSA pneumonia, duration of therapy \\nmust take into consideration the potential for complicated bacteremia with metastatic foci of \\ninfection ( endocarditis and osteomyelitis ),   necessitaiting a more prolonged course of \\nantibiotic therapy.', 'Recent reports document an increase in the frequency of SA pneumonia and the spread of \\nCA-MRSA has been accompanied by a rise in the incidence of severe pneumonia attributed to \\nthis pathogen. The current guidelines do not reflect the significant role that SA has in CAP \\ncomplicating influenza and the limited recommended diagnostic tests for CAP will frequently \\nfail to identify this organism. The ensuing antimicrobial therapy recommended by the same \\nguidelines frequently does not provide coverage for this etiologic agent.', 'It is therefore high \\nindex of suspicion that is relied upon for making the d iagnosis of SA and for institution of \\nantimicrobial therapy that provides coverage for CA -MRSA.

It was observed BAL was a reproducible diagnostic \\nmethod, especially when bacterial cultures are negative [72].', 'Similarly, in another study the quantitative culture  of EA showed persistence of the \\npathogenic bacteria  at a concentration of >105 CFU/ml in 82% of the repeat samples, \\nsugge sting that QEAs are reproducible and may be useful in diagnosing VAP [62]. 4 Role of Serial Culture  \\nRoutine QEAs performed twice a week anticipated the etiology  of a subsequent \\npneumonia  in 83% cases and aide d in prescription of adequate antibiotic  therapy  in 95% VAP \\npatients ultimately diagnosed by BAL culture  [73].', 'Delclaux  et al showed that lower airways  colonization  is consistently followed by VAP in \\ntwo thirds (66%) of episodes , supporting the need for serial culture  of lower respiratory tract \\nsecretions [74]. In a study which prospectively evaluated the role of routine  pre-VAP EA \\ncultures in appropriately treating VAP , a pre -VAP EA cult ure-based strategy was found to \\nappropriately treat  81% patients [75].', 'In the same study, the positive predictive values of  \\nPseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter baumannii , and methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus \\naureus  (MRSA) isolated from pre -VAP EA cultures were 88%, 83%, and 100%, respectively  \\n[75]. Therefore, it was suggested that whenever one of these pathogens  was isolated in routine \\nEA cultures and the patient subsequently develops VAP, appropriate antibiotic  for treatment  \\nof the pathogen isolated from routine EA culture should be administered [75].', 'But still the \\nrole of serial cultures in predicting the future VAP episodes and its usefulness in guiding \\nantibiotic therapy  is controversial  as another study has reported that no more than 35% of the \\nVAP pathogens were predicted by routine cultures [76]. Moreover, there is no data to indicate \\nthat this approach improves patient  survival  or reduces I CU/ hospital stay [77].', '3 Histopathological Examination and Culture of Lung Tissue  \\n \\nCombination of h istopathological examination  and quantitative culture  of lung tissue  \\nobtained by biopsy  or at autopsy  is generally considered the “gold standard” for diagnosis of \\nVAP , as the actual site of infection  is examined [16,61 ]. However, due to its invasive nature, \\nbiopsy c annot be performed in all patients suspected to have VAP [61]. For ante-mortem diagnosis of VAP, transbronchial  biopsy  is performed to obtain the lung \\ntissue , but this technique has not been well established  [35].', 'In case of post -mortem biopsy, \\nthe l ung tissue fragments  are obtained at least one hour after  death through an intercostal \\nincision extending from the median  clavicular line to the  median axillary line  [66]. For quantitative  culture  of lung tissue the colony count ≥ 104 cfu/ml is \\ncommonly used as threshold [66]. Histopathological pneumonia  is suspected usually based on \\nthe criteria described by Katzenstein and  Askin [78].', 'S tudies have shown that in \\nthe presence of  prior antibioti c treatment , many patients with histopathological  signs  of \\npneumonia have no or only minimal growth  from lung cultures  [43,79,80 ]. It is not \\nfeasible  to routinely perform invasive techniques  to obtain lung tissue  from all patients \\nsuspected to have VAP  [47]. Even when t he histo patho logical  examination is done, it is  very \\ndifficult to confirm the presence of pneumonia  and the criteria used  to define it are not \\nuniform  [43,81 ].', 'Moreover , in patients with VAP , the lesions  of bronchopneumonia  may be \\nlocalised  to certain  areas of the lungs  [79,82 ]. In a study \\nwhich evaluated the reproducibility of histopathological diagnosis of pneumonia, t here was a  \\nsignificant variation of about 18% to 38% in interpretation of the histopathological findings \\nby different pathologists [81]. Based on histopathological \\nexamination  it will not be possible to distinguish a recent  infection  from the sequelae of a \\nprevious infection  [83].', 'So, when histopathological results are used as standard, we have to \\nensure that the patient did not have any other lung infection in the recent past. Ventilator -Associated  Pneumonia  107 \\nwith VAP and so the evaluation of o ther diagnostic tools in comparison to these “gold \\nstandards” may not be fully justified [16].', 'In an epidemiological investigation by Alfieri et al it was shown that the \\nisolates recovered from ventilators, an in -line suction catheter  and patients with VAP were the \\nsame based on restriction fragment -length polymorphism  typing by pulsed -field gel  \\nelectrophoresis  (PFGE) [84]. They have concluded that such molecular typing methods are \\nuseful in detecting outbreaks caused by organisms spreading from contaminated equipment  or \\nan environmental source [84].', 'In another similar study, the same strains of Pseudomonas \\naeruginosa  and Acinetobacter baumannii  were isolated from patients with VAP and also \\nfrom the ICU milieu [85]. I n a study concerning nosocomially acquired Acinetobacter \\nbaumannii infection , ribotyping showed that an epidemic of 11 cases was coexisting with 17 \\nsporadic cases characterized by the diversity  of the banding patterns of the isolates [86]. The American Thoracic Society (ATS)  has formulated  certain guidelines  for management  \\nof patients with VAP [6].', 'Prompt and early administration of antibiotic  therapy  is very \\nimportant  as a delay in appropriate antibiotic therapy  is associated with excess morbidity  and \\nmortality  [6]. In a prospective study, patients with VAP, who had received inappropriate \\ntherapy and those with delayed initiation  of appropriate therapy, were ob served to have \\nincreased  CPIS and  high mortality  rate [88]. Moreover, a  delay of more than  2 days in administering the first dose of appropriate antibiotic \\ntherap y was observed to significantly prolong  the duration of ventilation  [89].', 'Alt hough early \\nappropriate antibiotics improve s survival  of patients with VAP, the risk of colonization  and \\nsubsequent superinfection with MDR pathogens  warns against the indiscriminate use of \\nempiric broa d-spectrum antibiotics in patients without infection  [15]. Piperacillin/tazobactam in combination with either aminoglycoside or ciprofloxacin has been \\nrecognised as an effective regimen for  empiric therapy  [90]. Addition of gentamicin to the above \\nregimen was found to further reduce the mortality [91].', 'A combination regimen including an \\nantipseudomonal  carbapenem or an antipseudomonal  cephalosp orin with either a \\nfluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside  is a good  alternative regimen for empirical therapy \\n[19]. The  aminoglycosides  have poor lung penetration and so they should not be used as \\nmonotherapy [19].', 'Porzecanski et al observed that an  approach based on \\nthe antibiotic  susceptibility  pattern of the local hospital or ICU pathogens , has the potential to \\nincrease the likelihood of adequate initial antibiotic therapy  and therefore can reduce the \\noverall use of antibiotics and the associated selection pressure for MDR bacteria  [92]. Whenever  a good clinical \\nresponse  with resolutio n of clinical features of infection  is observed , the duration of empiric \\ntherapy should be shorten ed from the traditional 14 to 21 days to about  7 days  [6].', 'A \\nrandomized controlled trial  proved that an antibiotic discontinuation policy  based on clinical \\nevidence  of a resolving VAP was associated with a decrease in the overall duration of \\nantibiotic treatment  [93]. aeruginosa , Acinetobacter  species  or other non -\\nfermenters  were identified as pathogens prolonged duration of treatment is recommended [6]. 1 De-Escalation Strategy  \\n \\nDe-escalation strategy is a promising approach for effective  management  of VAP  patients  \\nwithout contribu ting to development of drug resistance  [6,87 ].', 'According to this approach, \\nthe VAP patients are initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotic  regimen and later based \\non the clinical response  and culture  results the antibiotics are tailored down and unnecessary \\nantibiotics are withdrawn [6,94 ]. The initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage ensures early \\nadministration of appropriate therapy  and reduce s the cha nce of inadequate treatment , while \\nthe narrowing of antibiotics based on  culture results decreases the risk of development of drug \\nresistance  [94].', 'Based on a prospective study , Kollef et al suggest ed that patients with a clinical suspicion of \\nVAP and  culture -negative BAL can have empiric antimicrobial therapy  safely discontinued \\nwithin 72 h or in some cases  withheld altogether [95]. An  \\nunduly prolonged duration of antibiotic  treatment may favor development of drug resistance , \\nwhile a short course of treatment may result in treatment failure or relapse  [93]. They also observed that the  colonization  subseque ntly led to \\nrecurrence  of VAP due to drug resistant strains [96].', 'In a \\nlarge randomized tri al comparing the short course ( 8 days ) of antibiotic therapy and the \\ntraditional 15 days treatment, Chastre et al found that both the courses had  similar efficacy , \\nbut the longer course of antibiotic  therapy was associated with statistically greater  emergence \\nof multiply resistant bacteria  [97].

The clinical presentation in HIV-infected patients may differ from that in other immunocompromised patients, and its diagnosis continues to be challenging because no combination of symptoms, signs, blood chemistries, or radiographic findings is specific to Pneumocystis pneumonia.\\n\\nPneumonia can be characterized by its onset: early or late. Early onset pneumonia occurs during the first four days of hospitalization and is often caused by Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.\\n\\nThe book \"Pneumonia: Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment\" edited by Micaela L. discusses various topics related to pneumonia, including:\\n\\n* Modes of supportive treatment in patients with pneumonia\\n* Pneumocystis jirovecii in AIDS patients\\n* Nosocomial pneumonia surveillance and prevention in PICU and NICU\\n* Ventilator-associated pneumonia\\n* Community-acquired staphylococcal pneumonia associated with influenza\\n* Radiological patterns of pulmonary infections\\n\\nIt also highlights the challenges in determining healthcare-associated pneumonia in immunocompromised, elderly, infants, or newborns, and the need for alternate specific criteria for these patients.\\n\\nI hope this information helps!'"]},"execution_count":19,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["Genrate_Answer(llm,load_data,input_text1,10,0.4,\"Hybrid_bpemb\")"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kaggle":{"accelerator":"nvidiaTeslaT4","dataSources":[{"datasetId":5502705,"sourceId":9116419,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30747,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
